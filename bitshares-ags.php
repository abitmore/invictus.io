						<h3>Support BitShares Development</h3>					
						<p style="text-align: justify;">								
              The Internet has spawned a new era that is transforming our society like never before, simultaneously giving us 
              new freedoms and exposing us to previously-inconceivable levels of surveillance and control.  Invictus is
              leading the way toward a more free society through the development of new technologies that enable the decentralization
              of everything from banking to voting.

              We are committed to building technologies that are so decentralized that they are beyond our control once developed.  Building
              these technologies requires significant funding and gives us no direct sources of revenue.  Undeterred from our mission to
              develop freedom-giving technologies, we have created an opportunity for those who would like to support the cause: BitShares AGS. 
					  </p>

						<h3>How will the funds be used?</h3>	
					  <p style="text-align: justify;">								
              Invictus is committed to using every resource at our disposal to secure the right to life, liberty and property for
              all of mankind.  We will use all funds in a manner that we feel will best achieve these objectives and we will maintain
              a public transaction ledger that outlines how we are allocating the funds given to us. That said, these are no-strings-attached
              gifts and should not be construed to place any legal obligation on Invictus to provide anything in return
              for these funds.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              You should only support us if you believe we are a good cause and you trust us to use the funds wisely.  
            </p>
            <h3> Public Accounting of Supporters </h3>

            We feel that those who support this cause should be given public credit as a thank you for helping the cause.  We have suggested that
            this credit be scored by awarding 10,000 points (AGS) each day divided among supporters proportional to how many BTC or PTS they
            send to the ANGEL addresses.
